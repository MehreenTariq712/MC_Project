        android:text="The German Shepherd is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English language,
 the breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog (GSD). The breed was officially known as the
 Alsatian in the UK from after the First World War until 1977

 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd.Despite its primitive, wolf-like appearance,
 the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.
As a herding dog, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep.
 Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds
 around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance,
 search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting." />
